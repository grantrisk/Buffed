# CSC 450 - Team Project
Meal-Planner + Calorie Tracker Web App

## 1. Project Description
Our application - will use web technologies to allow the average person to be able to look up recommended meals throughout the day.  This will be based on the calorie limit as well as macronutrient proportions they wish to achieve. This application will be targeting individuals looking to improve their health through nutrition and dieting.  It will provide a user-friendly interface for those looking to improve their health and physique, whether they are at home or on the run.

## 5. Feature List
>1 sentence bullets beginning with "The user can..." or "The system will..." that illustrate the features (capabilities) of your software product. These should be written at a high level. For example, "The user can add and remove stock symbols they would like to track to their dashboard." You must have 10-20 features. <br>

>Next to each feature, write the name of the team member responsible for analyzing the "Data Required" for the feature per the next item. <br>

* The user will be able to enter in their desired calorie count to choose through meals.
* The user will be given recipes/meals based on calories remaining as well as macronutrients remaining. 
* Our system will connect to a recipe database that will provide the users with meal choices as well as the nutrient count and complete recipes for those meals.
* Once the user has chosen a meal, they will be able to see the remaining calories left for that day, and will be able to continue the progression throughout the day.
* Our application may recommend workout times based on meal carbohydrate consumption.

## 6. Data Required
>Given your Feature List, think deeply about the data your software will need to function. For example, you may need user's names, emails, and addresses. You may need a list of all stock symbols traded on the NYSE. You may have a chat/messaging feature in which case you need usernames and chat contents including text and shared images. Do not agonize over predicting the future correctly, but try to be thorough with respect to our Feature List. <br>

>DO NOT go down the rabbit hole of over-specifying at this point -- your goal is to have a sense at a high level of what you will need. Itemize your data in a bulleted list that groups related data, e.g. for a food delivery service: <br>

>"We will need our user's contact information: email, street address, phone number." <br>

>"We will need menu options: name of the dish, main ingredients or a description, cost, is it an appetizer, main dish, dessert, etc.?" <br>

* Personalized options may require an account which may need email, password, height/weight.
* We will need to connect to a recipe database to pull recipes from.

## 7. Platform
>Identify if your software product a web application, a desktop application, or mobile application. If more than one, identify which ones. <br>

**Desktop Application**

## 8. Implementation Technologies
>What will you be using to create this product? What language(s) will you be using? If using a specific technology, such as AI/ML, do you know which library or software you will use? If creating a web application, do you know which web app framework you will use? The Lead Developer and the Project Manager are responsible for researching technologies that may be useful (this work can be delegated), but all team members must contribute to the discussion. <br>
