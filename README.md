## 5. Feature List
>1 sentence bullets beginning with "The user can..." or "The system will..." that illustrate the features (capabilities) of your software product. These should be written at a high level. For example, "The user can add and remove stock symbols they would like to track to their dashboard." You must have 10-20 features. <br>

>Next to each feature, write the name of the team member responsible for analyzing the "Data Required" for the feature per the next item. <br>

**_TBD_** <br>

## 6. Data Required
>Given your Feature List, think deeply about the data your software will need to function. For example, you may need user's names, emails, and addresses. You may need a list of all stock symbols traded on the NYSE. You may have a chat/messaging feature in which case you need usernames and chat contents including text and shared images. Do not agonize over predicting the future correctly, but try to be thorough with respect to our Feature List. <br>

>DO NOT go down the rabbit hole of over-specifying at this point -- your goal is to have a sense at a high level of what you will need. Itemize your data in a bulleted list that groups related data, e.g. for a food delivery service: <br>

>"We will need our user's contact information: email, street address, phone number." <br>

>"We will need menu options: name of the dish, main ingredients or a description, cost, is it an appetizer, main dish, dessert, etc.?" <br>

## 7. Platform
>Identify if your software product a web application, a desktop application, or mobile application. If more than one, identify which ones. <br>

**Desktop Application**

## 8. Implementation Technologies
>What will you be using to create this product? What language(s) will you be using? If using a specific technology, such as AI/ML, do you know which library or software you will use? If creating a web application, do you know which web app framework you will use? The Lead Developer and the Project Manager are responsible for researching technologies that may be useful (this work can be delegated), but all team members must contribute to the discussion. <br>
