Meal-Planner + Calorie Tracker Web App

## 1. Project Description
Our application __**BUFFED**__ will use web technologies to allow the average person to be able to look up recommended meals throughout the day.  This will be based on the calorie limit as well as macronutrient proportions they wish to achieve. This application will be targeting individuals looking to improve their health through nutrition and dieting.  It will provide a user-friendly interface for those looking to improve their health and physique, whether they are at home or on the run.
